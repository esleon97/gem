## Testing Workflow

1. Run the ```SVM.ipynb``` notebook to predict labels for the testing dataset
2. Run the ```SVMBrowser.ipynb``` notebook to look at classification statistics and waveforms
3. Run the ```Monitoring.ipynb``` script to look at classification statistics per HV filter, CC4, and detector string
